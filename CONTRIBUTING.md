#How to contribute

If you use this codebase for further development we would like you to share you development to make it available for others. 
For this we recommend the following steps:

1. Start with forking the project to your own code base, preferrably within the ATI GitHub.
2. When you want to contribute, make a pull request to the Test branch.
